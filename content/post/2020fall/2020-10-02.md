## Abstract:

Data science is discussed along with some historical perspective.  Selected problems in classification are considered, either via specific datasets or general problem types.  In each case, the problem is introduced before one or more potential solutions are discussed and applied.  The problems discussed include data with outliers, longitudinal data, and three-way data.  The proposed approaches are generally mixture model-based.
