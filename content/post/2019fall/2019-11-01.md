## Abstract:

The work is motivated by the inflexibility of Bayesian modeling; in that only parameters of
probability models are required to be connected with data. The idea is to generalize this by
allowing arbitrary unknowns to be connected with data via loss functions. An updating process
is then detailed which can be viewed as arising in at least a couple of ways - one being purely
axiomatically driven.
The further exploration of replacing probability model based approaches to inference with loss
functions is ongoing. Joint work with Chris Holmes, Pier Giovanni Bissiri and Simon Lyddon.
