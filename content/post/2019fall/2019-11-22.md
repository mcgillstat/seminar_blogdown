## Abstract:

The stochastic inverse problem of determining probability
structures on input parameters for a physics model corresponding to a
given probability structure on the output of the model forms the core of
scientific inference and engineering design. We describe a formulation
and solution method for stochastic inverse problems that is based on
functional analysis, differential geometry, and probability/measure
theory. This approach yields a computationally tractable problem while
avoiding alterations of the model like regularization and ad hoc
assumptions about the probability structures. We present several
examples, including a high-dimensional application to determination of
parameter fields in storm surge models. We also describe work aimed at
defining a notion of condition for stochastic inverse problems and
tackling the related problem of designing sets of optimal observable
quantities.
