## Abstract:

In this talk, we discuss two problems of semiparametric estimation and variable selection for
length-biased data with heavy censoring.
The common feature of the proposed estimation procedures in the literature is that they only
put probability mass on failure times.
Under length-biased sampling, however, censoring is informative and failing to incorporate
censored observations into estimation can lead to
a substantial loss of efficiency. We propose two estimation procedures by computing the
likelihood contribution of both uncensored and censored observations.
For variable selection problem, we introduce a unified penalized estimating function and use an
optimization algorithm to solve it. We discuss
the asymptotic properties of the resulting penalized estimators. The work is motivated by the
International stroke Trial dataset collected in
Argentina in which the survival times of about 88% of the 545 cases are censored.
