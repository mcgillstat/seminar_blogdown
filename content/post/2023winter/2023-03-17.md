## Abstract:

Over the last 20 years, the speaker has delved into  the origins of 'regression';  the development of the 't' and 'Poisson' distributions; forerunners of the 'hazard' function; and the statistical design and conduct of US Selective Service lotteries from 1917 onwards.  This talk will recount the stories, data and simulations behind some of these, and provide some modern-day re-enactments.
