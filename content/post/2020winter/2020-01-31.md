## Abstract:

I'll discuss the use of observational data to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome.
This task is complicated by the presence of "confounders" that influence both treatment and outcome, inducing
observed associations that are not causal. Causal estimation is achieved by adjusting for this confounding by
using observed covariate information. I'll discuss the case where we observe covariates that carry
sufficient information for the adjustment. But where explicit models relating treatment, outcome, covariates and 
confounding are not available.
