## Abstract:

Clustering is a fundamental tool for uncovering heterogeneity in data, yet a longstanding challenge lies in assessing whether detected clusters represent genuine structure or arise from sampling variability, and in determining which variables drive the clustering structure. Statistical significance clustering (SigClust; Liu et al. (2008)) addresses the first challenge by testing the cluster index under a Gaussian null, estimating its distribution via Monte Carlo simulation in high dimensions. We propose SigClust-DE, which builds on recent advances in high-dimensional covariance estimation to improve the accuracy of SigClust and extends it to variable-level inference. In particular, SigClust-DE unifies clustering significance testing and differential expression (DE) analysis, a central task in RNA-seq studies. By leveraging the Monte Carlo framework, our method controls type I error while maintaining high power for variable selection. Through extensive simulations and an application to RNA-seq data, we show that SigClust-DE achieves more accurate covariance estimation, effectively controls false discoveries, and substantially improves power in detecting differentially expressed variables, providing a general framework for clustering significance and variable-level inference in high-dimensional data.
