## Abstract:

The change-point analysis is more than sixty years old. Over this long period, it has been an important subject of interest in many scientific disciplines such as finance and econometrics, bioinformatics and genomics, climatology, engineering, and technology.  

In this talk, I will provide a general overview of the topic alongside some historical notes. I will then review the most recent and transformative advancements on the subject. Finally, I will discuss the change-point methodologies that my research team has developed over the past several years, covering various complex data structures.
