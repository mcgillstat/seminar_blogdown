## Abstract:

In this talk, we consider constructing a confidence interval for a
target policy’s value offline based on pre-collected observational
data in infinite horizon settings. Most of the existing works assume
no unmeasured variables exist that confound the observed actions. This
assumption, however, is likely to be violated in real applications
such as healthcare and technological industries. We show that with
some auxiliary variables that mediate the effect of actions on the
system dynamics, the target policy’s value is identifiable in a
confounded Markov decision process. Based on this result, we develop
an efficient off-policy value estimator that is robust to potential
model misspecification and provides rigorous uncertainty
quantification.
