## Abstract:

During the last decade, hundreds of machine learning methods have been developed
for disease outcome prediction based on high-throughput genomics data. However, the quality
of the input genomics features and the output clinical variables has been ignored in these
algorithms. In this talk, I will introduce two studies that develop methods to learn more
accurate molecular signatures and drug response values for cancer research. These studies are
supported by NSF, NIH, and Moffitt Cancer Center.


## Speaker

Dr. Wei Zhang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and
Genomics and Bioinformatics Cluster at UCF. His research interests include computational
biology and machine learning. His research has centered on investigating the role of
transcriptome variants in diseases, spanning from technique-driven research (e.g., algorithm
development for disease outcome prediction), to hypothesis-driven investigation of specific
biological problems. Dr. Zhang received NSF CRII award in 2018 and NIDDK dkNET New
Investigator Award in 2020. Lab webpage: https://server.cs.ucf.edu/compbio/
